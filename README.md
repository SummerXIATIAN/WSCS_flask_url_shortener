  ## Description

  In this project, we created a REST URL-shortener service that can generate and store unique short IDs for each new url. It serves three purposes:

  - **MAIN**: We first check the correctness of a new url, and if it is correct, we generate a unique short ID for it by combining three random characters and letters. By clicking the short url, users can go to the original website.

  - **STAT**: Users can change the shord ID or delete any short url stored in the database; we keep track of how many times the user visit it.

  - **CLEAR_ALL**: Delete all of the short urls in the database.
