# WCSC Assignment 3.1 README -- url_shortener

### DECLARATION

In assignment 3, we used the reference implementation of `url_shortener` and `users_auth` from Canvas (assignment2-barebone). Our work is to deploy each service on container via docker.

### Code

Run the python script and it will invoke a flask service on 5001 port

`python url-shortener.py`

## build

`docker build -t summerxia2009/wcsc_url .`

## run

We uploaded the packaged image to docker hub, which became a publicly accessible repository under my own docker hub account.

`docker pull summerxia2009/wcsc_url`

`docker run -p 5001:5001 summerxia2009/wcsc_url`

## test by postman on 127.0.0.1:5001
